1) Overview

    Part of the original design goal of the EIL Linux Client Agent was to have
an install system that was distribution agnostic- meaning it would behave the
same on all supported distributions and no distribution-specific packages would
have to be maintained (see README for more details).

    This document describes the build as well as installation process for the
EIL Linux Client Agent. The intention is to get someone up-and-running as
quickly as possible, thus we will start from a very high-level and then hone in
on more detail.

1.a) How to read this document

    The first sections talk about basic installation using the install tools.
These sections will be from a very high level and will assume only a very basic
understanding of Linux and the Linux command line.

    Later sections will deal with lower level build and the installation
process "under the hood". Think of these sections as a behind the scenes
explanation of the build and installation system.

2) Introduction to the install tool

    The highest level interface to the EIL Linux Client agent build/install
system is the install tool,

            * install_tool.sh

3) Package Installation

3.a) Building a package
3.b) Making a repository
3.c) Installing a package using the bootstrap
3.d) Installing a package manually

4) Manually installing the dispatcher
5) Manually building the steward
