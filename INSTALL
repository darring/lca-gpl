1) Overview

    Part of the original design goal of the EIL Linux Client Agent was to have
an install system that was distribution agnostic- meaning it would behave the
same on all supported distributions and no distribution-specific packages would
have to be maintained (see README for more details).

    This document describes the build as well as installation process for the
EIL Linux Client Agent. The intention is to get someone up-and-running as
quickly as possible, thus we will start from a very high-level and then hone in
on more detail.

1.a) How to read this document

    The first sections talk about basic installation using the install tools.
These sections will be from a very high level and will assume only a very basic
understanding of Linux and the Linux command line.

    Later sections will deal with lower level build and the installation
process "under the hood". Think of these sections as a behind the scenes
explanation of the build and installation system.

2) Introduction to the install tool

    The highest level interface to the EIL Linux Client agent build/install
system is the install tool,

            * install_tool.sh

if the install tool is run without any options, the following usage text is
displayed:

    Usage: install_tool.sh [OPTION]
    Where [OPTION] is one of the following

        --install       Installs the client agent on the system
                        (building as needed)

        --uninstall     Uninstalls the client agent from the system

        --pkginstall    Install the client agent from a package
                        (should not be called unless you know what you are doing)

        --instdisp      Installs just the dispatcher on the system

        --inststew      Installs just the steward on the system

        --uninstdisp    Uninstalls the dispatcher

        --uninststew    Uninstalls the steward

        --build         Build the steward (rebuilding if needed)

        --static        Build the steward with static linking (rebuilding if
                        needed)

        --clean         Clean the steward build environment

        --runtest       Run all the unit tests

        --doc           Install just the documentation

        --pkg           Build an installable package (static linked)

        --makerepo      Build installable package and make a repo.
                        Requires an additional option specifying the URI
                        we should use for the repo. E.g.:
                        --makerepo SOMESERVER:/home/pub/releases/.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following helper options can be added to --pkginstall or --pkg

        -r              The installable package is a release package.
                        This means that the installable package will be named
                        generically if called with --pkg and that the output will
                        go to a log file in /var/log if called with --pkginstall.

    If ran without any options, this usage text will be displayed.
