XSConsoleData.py contains Reconfigure* which calls the above to signal a network
change (somehow this works, something else happens, but it doesn't work when we
call on our own).

XSFeatureInterface.py seems to be where the actual UI calls the above.
(HandleRenewChoice)
.DisableManagement (XSConsoleData)
.ReconfigureManagement(pif, 'DHCP', '', '', '')
.Update()  (XSConsoleData)

xe host-management-disable

obtaining a pif:
    xe pif-list | grep "^uuid" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 2
    stick that in a $UUID
    then issue:
        xe pif-unplug uuid=${UUID}
        xe pif-plug uuid=${UUID}

    for each variable from the above list

finding the ip after it's gone:
    IP=$(xe pif-param-get uuid="${UUID}" param-name="IP")
