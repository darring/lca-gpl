EIL Linux Client Agent 4.3.0.1.d20110718 Release
------------------------------------------------

The Linux Client Agent version 4.3.0.1 (d20110718) is now in production. This
release includes Node Manager support (via NMSA), machine asset collection, and
other improvements.

New OS provisions of currently supported Linux distros will automatically get
this version. Existing Linux provisions can be upgraded manually via a number
of ways:

        *) Running the update check script (as root) at
        /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/tools/update-checker.sh

        *) Having the Portal issue an upgrade command (I am not certain if
        the current production release of the Portal has this option integrated
        yet. If it does, the Linux Client Agent will accept it.)

** NODE MANAGER SUPPORT

The Linux client agent can now interact with the EIL Test Automation Framework
(NMSA Server) on platforms that are Node Manager enabled. During installation,
the Linux Client Agent performs tests to determine if the system is NM capable,
and sets up a "NMSA Handler" daemon which manages local test workloads and
NMSA interaction.

You can view the installation log at

    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/client-agent-base.log

to determine if the NMSA Handler was setup properly by looking for entries
similar to the following:

    2011-07-20 02:04:41 PDT : laf_test: Checking program requirements...
    2011-07-20 02:04:41 PDT : laf_test: Found '/usr/bin/wget'....
    2011-07-20 02:04:41 PDT : laf_test: Checking for proper init scripts...
    2011-07-20 02:04:41 PDT : laf_test: detected an RHEL or SLES derived distro...
    2011-07-20 02:04:41 PDT : laf_test: ipmi init found, starting
    2011-07-20 02:04:42 PDT : laf_test: Checking for device requirements...
    2011-07-20 02:04:42 PDT : laf_test: Found device '/dev/ipmi0'...
    2011-07-20 02:04:42 PDT : laf_test: System capable of LAF/NMSA, setting up...

The handler itself can be controlled via the nmsa_handler init script:

    Usage: /etc/init.d/nmsa_handler.sh {start|stop|status|restart}

It can be configured by editing the following file and restarting the handler,

    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/nmsa_handler.cfg

and its activity can be viewed via the NMSA Handler log found at

    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/nmsa_handler.log

** EXISTING CCMS SUPPORT

The existing "Steward" daemon for interfacing with CCMS/RMS has had minor
performance and reliability tweaks related to the NMSA and Asset work. It can
still be interacted with via the eil_steward.sh init script

    Usage: /etc/init.d/eil_steward.sh {start|stop|status|restart|asset}

and its logs can still be viewed via syslog as well as the following sub-system
specific logs:
    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/ccms-agent.log
    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/client-agent-base.log
    /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/home/client-agent-error.log

** ASSET COLLECTION

This functionality was available previously, however manual installation of the
asset collection script was required. The asset collection script has now been
added to the install process so it will be included automatically on systems
that support it.

The asset collection happens automatically at boot, but you can force a fresh
re-collection at any time by using the eil_steward.sh init script with the
"asset" option.
