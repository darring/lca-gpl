1) Overview

    The Dispatcher includes shell libraries which can be utilized in external
shell scripts. These libraries provide a number of unique features including
distribution detection and abstraction,

1.a) Installation location, and importing the libraries

    In keeping with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
(http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) and LANANA (http://www.lanana.org/), the
Dispatcher libraries are installed into

        * /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/lib/

    The various libraries contained in this system-wide directory can be
included in your shell script in a variety of ways. However, the most platform-
agnostic way is to use the dot-execute directive:

        DSP_LIB_PATH="/opt/intel/eil/clientagent/lib"
        . ${DSP_LIB_PATH}/helper.sh

2) The Dispatcher APIs

2.a) dispatcher.sh
    The dispatcher.sh library abstracts the underlying platform for running
commands. It requires the 'globals.sh' library to be loaded.

2.b) globals.sh

    This library defines a number of global variables utilized by the EIL
Dispatcher. Unless you are extending the dispatcher itself, or using some of the
internal Dispatcher functionality, you probably will not need to use anything
here.

2.c) helper.sh

    This library contains a number of helper features which are utilized by the
Dispatcher, but which should be general enough that arbitrary scripts can use
it as well.

2.c.1) Platform specification

    By simply sourcing the helper.sh script, you will gain access to information
about the underlying Linux distribution. A number of environmental variables
will be defined describing the distribution.

        * IS_RHEL
        * IS_DEB
        * IS_SLES
        * IS_ESX
        * IS_ANGSTROM

    One of the above will be set to 'yes' (with the others remaining unset)
which will define the general distribution flavor.

    Beyond the flavor of the distribution, you can additionally check the
variable

        * PLATFORM_NAME

which will contain a string detailing the more specific dialect of the
distribution.

    For example, CentOS would be defined as:

        * IS_RHEL=yes
        * PLATFORM_NAME="centos"

2.c.2) Logging functions

    The helper library contains two functions for logging:

        * trace()
            - This function will log to the standard client agent log file,
              which defaults to ${HOME_DIR}/client-agent-base.log .

        * trace_error()
            - This function will log to the client agent error log file, which
              defaults to ${HOME_DIR}/client-agent-error.log .

2.c.3) Date functions

    The helper library provides a number of functions which assist in high-level
date logic.

        * date_utc_stamp()
            - This function takes a parameter of a date string (or "now" to
              indicate the current time) and returns a specially formatted UTC
              stamp which can be used by the other date functions.

        * date_utc_stamp_delta()
            - This function takes three parameters. The first parameter is one
              of:
                 -s : second
                 -m : minute
                 -d : day
              The next two parameters are UTC date stamps (returned from
              date_utc_stamp). It will compute and return the delta (in whatever
              format you request) between the two date stamps.

2.c.4) Network functions

    The helper library provides a number of functions which assist with various
network items.

        * get_system_ip()
            - This function returns the system's IP information. It requires
              working grep, cut and awk commands.

        * is_hosts_setup()
            - This function queries the /etc/hosts file to verify whether or
              not the EIL entries are in place. It returns 0 upon success
              (meaning the entries are there) or 1 on failure (meaning the
              entries are not there).

              The main reason this function exists (though it can easily have
              uses elsewhere) was because of a need on XenClient where the
              hosts file was being destroyed at odd times after boot causing
              TCP diagnostic script runs which resulted in Linux client agent
              hangs.
