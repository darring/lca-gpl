1) Overview

    The Dispatcher includes shell libraries which can be utilized in external
shell scripts. These libraries provide a number of unique features including
distribution detection and abstraction,

1.a) Installation location, and importing the libraries

    In keeping with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
(http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) and LANANA (http://www.lanana.org/), the
Dispatcher libraries are installed into

        * /opt/intel/eil/clientagent/lib/

    The various libraries contained in this system-wide directory can be
included in your shell script in a variety of ways. However, the most platform-
agnostic way is to use the dot-execute directive:

        DSP_LIB_PATH="/opt/intel/eil/clientagent/lib"
        . ${DSP_LIB_PATH}/helper.sh

2) The Dispatcher APIs

2.a) dispatcher.sh
    The dispatcher.sh library abstracts the underlying platform for running
commands. It requires the 'globals.sh' library to be loaded.

    *** TODO ***

2.b) globals.sh

    This library defines a number of global variables utilized by the EIL
Dispatcher. Unless you are extending the dispatcher itself, or using some of the
internal Dispatcher functionality, you probably will not need to use anything
here.

2.c) helper.sh

    This library contains a number of helper features which are utilized by the
Dispatcher, but which should be general enough that arbitrary scripts can use
it as well.

2.c.1) Platform specification

	By simply sourcing the helper.sh script, you will gain access to information
about the underlying Linux distribution. A number of environmental variables
will be defined describing the distribution.

		* IS_RHEL
		* IS_DEB
		* IS_SLES
		* IS_ESX
		* IS_XEN
		
	One of the above will be set to 'yes' (with the others remaining unset)
which will define the general distribution flavor.

	Beyond the flavor of the distribution, you can additionally check the
variable

		* PLATFORM_NAME

which will contain a string detailing the more specific dialect of the
distribution.

	For example, CentOS would be defined as:
	
		* IS_RHEL=yes
		* PLATFORM_NAME="centos"
