1) Overview

    This document describes the attempts to make various cross-platform version
control systems work with the existing TFS install utilized by the EIL team. It
explains what was tried, what worked, what did not work, why it did not work,
and why we ultimately could not integrate Linux with TFS.

2) History, git/tfs bridge

    In October 2010, one of the first tasks of the Linux Client agent port was
to set up some sort of bridge between the Linux development environment and the
Windows TFS codebase which contained all of the existing C#/.NET/Windows-centric
project code to date.

    The first, and most actively maintained, project which was found that seemed
to provide a way for us to build this bridge was the git/tfs project on github:

        * https://github.com/spraints/git-tfs

    The following set-up was built:

    [ Original Windows TFS ] --> [ Windows Cygwin/SSH git/tfs gateway ] --> ..

    .. --> [ Linux git repo ] --> [ Linux dev environment ]

    This worked for files already *in* TFS, but new files could not be added
without TFS reporting an error.

3) Hg/tfs bridge

    In November 2010, hg (Mercurial, see README) was chosen due to its cross-
platform nature and the fact that it integrated with Windows shell (TortoiseHg).
Effort was made to integrate hg with TFS. The hgtfshook was found and used:

        * http://hgtfshook.codeplex.com/

    A setup similar to the above was built (except no Cygwin gateway, and
replace git with hg), however, the same problems were encountered.

4) Conclusion

    The problem with TFS is that it is designed to work with integrated
development environments such as Visual Studio. Because we are not using a
Windows-centric IDE (Visual Studio) we are working outside of the design
specifications of TFS. Thus, we do not have permission to add files to the
repository and our changes must be made in highly convoluted ways.

    At this time, there does not seem any way to integrate the Linux Client
agent development with TFS.

    It is worth noting, however, that there are many new hg/tfs projects popping
up on various Open Source hosting sites every day and that the issues we've
encountered may be resolved by another clever developer given time.
