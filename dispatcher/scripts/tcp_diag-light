# TCP diagnostic tool for the client agent (light version)

# This tool is to be called when the steward has detected a TCP error from a
# SOAP connection (e.g., it has tried to connect to CCMS, and a general TCP
# error was the result). This is the "light" version of the tool, it assumes
# the problem is solveable with a simple re-up of the network interfaces, and
# cannot do much additional logic to determine if previous attempts were
# successful or not. This is unfortunate, but due to the nature of the platforms
# on which it is used, that is a limitation.
