* Further re-test items now that we have done massive re-working of installer
  items to make ESXi happy (especially on systems where BASH/ash/dash will be
  an issue).

* Find out why steward is crashing on ESXi after we attempt to call CCMS
  (debugging is going to be hard there...)

* Continue work on steward command interpreting

* Once steward is accepting commands, continue work on dispatcher

* Fully isolate gSOAP interfaces to stewardService, and instrument
  stewardService as a possible dynamically loadable library (optional build
  parameter). This is in the event that we decide to move the client agent off
  network and are forced to deal with GPL compliance issues, we then have the
  option of LGPL'ing the stewardService itself and leaving the rest of the
  agent unencumbered.
