* Further re-test items now that we have done massive re-working of installer
  items to make ESXi happy (especially on systems where BASH/ash/dash will be
  an issue).

* Find out why steward is crashing on ESXi after we attempt to call CCMS
  (debugging is going to be hard there...)

* Continue work on steward command interpreting

* Once steward is accepting commands, continue work on dispatcher
