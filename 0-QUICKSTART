EIL Linux Client Agent Dev/Build Quickstart
-------------------------------------------

The intent of this guide is to get a developer up and running quickly with a
proper build and development environment for the EIL Linux Client Agent. It is
not intended to be a guide for developing the agent itself, nor is it intended
to be any sort of in depth documentation for the project.
