 * eil_steward.c
 * -------------
 * Description:
 *  The steward is the thin gSOAP-based application which communicates
 *  with the CCMS, accepts commands, and hands them to the dispatcher
 *  (which is already installed on the system)
 * License Note:
 *  Please see the associated LICENSE file included with the source
 *  repository of this application for special license considerations.
 *  In a nutshell, parts of this application are based upon gSOAP, and
 *  depending upon how it is built (dynamic vs. static linking) it may
 *  also include GNU libc and other LGPL libraries. Care must be given
 *  in redistributing this application, its binary and its source, as
 *  redistribution outside of Intel will result in placing this software
 *  under the GPL for compliance.
