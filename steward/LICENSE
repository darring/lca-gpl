The eil_steward component of the Linux Client Agent is built utilizing
gSOAP (http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net/). gSOAP has a number of different
licensing considerations.[a]

1) gSOAP is distributed under The GNU General Public License.

    All of gSOAP is available under The GPL, which means anyone is legally
    allowed to create derived applications from gSOAP and distributed them
    under the same license (GPL).

2) Specific sub-components of gSOAP are also licensed under the gSOAP
 Public License 1.3, which is based on the Mozilla Public License 1.1.

    The gSOAP Public License is a permissive license[b] and allows total
    re-licensing freedom with regards to derivative works. The gSOAP
    Public License covers all sub-components of gSOAP not covered by part
    "3" below.

3) Specific sub-components of gSOAP are also licensed under the gSOAP
 Commercial License.

    The gSOAP Commercial License "is for use with the wsdl2h WSDL parser,
    UDDI code, and sample applications which are only licensed under the
    GPL or the gSOAP Commercial License"[c].

----

We use code which is generated with the wsdl2h parser, so we will be
bound by licensing considerations "1" and "3" above.

However, we do *not* need to redistribute our software under the GPL,
nor do we need to apply for a gSOAP Commercial License provided that we
do one thing.

The GPL *only* requires GPL-compliance in the event that we release a
modified version of a GPL-derived application publically. If we use the
modified version internally, we are not required to release our source[d].

So, provided that we are careful and *only* utilize the eil_steward
internally inside Intel, we will not be required by the GPL requirements
to make our source public.
