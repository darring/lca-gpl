 This script must be run in a Debian-derived distribution (such as Ubuntu)!

 If you wish to build the EIL Linux client agent in another distribution, please
 see the BUILD_ENV text file and the source for this script to find the proper
 dependencies necessary to set up your build environment!

 This script will set up a stock Debian or Ubuntu install for development and
 building of the EIL Linux client agent.

 If you are not using Debian or Ubuntu, then take a look at this script (and the
 BUILD_ENV text file) for more information about the EIL Linux client agent's
 requirements. If you are building or developing on a distribution other than
 Debian or Ubuntu, it is left up to you to figure out what is needed for a proper
 development environment.

 This script will have a number of interactive sections, please read everything
 carefully and answer the questions with caution.
