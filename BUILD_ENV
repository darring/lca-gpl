1) Overview of build requirements

    The EIL Linux client agent requires a number of items in order to build.
These items are too numerous, and many are defined dynamically based upon
external dependency build processes, to be listed in great detail. However, from
a very high level, the following items are required in order to build the EIL
Linux client agent:

        * gSOAP 2.8.0
            - Newer versions of gSOAP might work as well, but older versions
            will not. We depend on very specific WS-Addressing plugins only
            available in versions past 2.8.0 . It is left up to the developer to
            establish if a newer version of gSOAP will work, and what (if any)
            modifications to the Linux client agent codebase must happen in
            order to support it.

        * gcc 4.4.x
            - A minimum of gcc 4.4.x is required. Older versions may work as
            well, but are untested.

        * make 3.81
            - Realistically, any recent version of make should work, however,
            3.81 was the exact version present on all distros at the time of
            initial development. Due to design constraints (simple build) we
            wind up having relatively simple makefiles that should work in any
            version of GNU make.

        * bash 3.x
            - Versions of bash in the 3.x to 4.x range have been tested with
            the code in the EIL Linux client agent. Realistically, any version
            of bash within the last decade and into the future should work fine.

1.a) Building gSOAP in the development environment

    The gSOAP development libraries need a variety of items in order to be built
in your build environment. These include (but are not limitted to):

        * flex
        * automake
        * autoconf
        * autotools-dev
        * byacc
        * bison
        * libssl-dev

    These are the names of the packages as they are listed in Debian/Ubuntu, if
you are building gSOAP under another distribution you will have to find other
equivalent options.

    byacc and bison provide similar functionality, but different sections of
the gSOAP build process apparently use different aspects of their features in
different ways, so they are both included for completeness. There may be a way
to reduce these requirements down a single parser, but it is left up to later
developers on the project to find out if this is the case.

2) Building in a Debian/Ubuntu install
