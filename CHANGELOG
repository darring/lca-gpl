# Note- This changelog is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all changes
#       in this project. For that, please consult the version control system log
#       (hg log, or TortoiseHG Explorer). Instead, this is intended to encompass
#       any major changes that need mentioning.
#
#       Additionally, the format of this log is such that we could (if we wanted
#       to) simply add it to an RPM spec file in the future.

* Wed Dec 15 2010 - Sam Hart <samx.hart@intel.com>
- Begin Changelog file (admittedly late in the game).
- Significant replacement of stock commands (tr, install, unlink) with
  functional equivalents due to ESXi limitations.
- Change hard BASH requirements to generalized /bin/sh requirements in scripts
  where this is acceptable (again, due to ESXi limitations). One exception is
  install_tool.sh where we now need a second, custom ESXi install_tool.

* Mon Jan 3 2011 - Sam Hart <samx.hart@intel.com>

* Tue Jan 11 2011 - Sam Hart <samx.hart@intel.com>

- Add two versions of a TCP diagnose tool which can be used to fix VLAN switch
  issues.
