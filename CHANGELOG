# Note- This changelog is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all changes
#       in this project. For that, please consult the version control system log
#       (hg log, or TortoiseHG Explorer). Instead, this is intended to encompass
#       any major changes that need mentioning.
#
#       Additionally, the format of this log is such that we could (if we wanted
#       to) simply add it to an RPM spec file in the future.

- Begin Changelog file (admittedly late in the game).
- Significant replacement of stock commands (tr, install, unlink) with
  functional equivalents due to ESXi limitations.
