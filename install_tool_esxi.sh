# Linux Client Agent Installation Tool (ESXi variant)
#----------------------------------------------------
# This tool is intended to assist in the installation and packaging of the
# Linux Client Agent
#
# Unfortunately, we need a specific variant for ESXi, as there doesn't seem to
# be a way to make both ESXi and the other major distros happy at the same time
# with the main install tool.
