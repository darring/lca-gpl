# Command dispatcher

# This is the general command processor.
#
# Its job is to take the incoming commands from the client agent
# directory, interpret what they mean, and then dispatch them to the
# various bit players around the Linux box which ultimately perform
# those actions we need done (rebooting, domain join/unjoining, etc.)
